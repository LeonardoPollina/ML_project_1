In our case, I think that the proper way to proceed to perform a git push
is the following:

1) git pull
It's important to do te pull BEFORE doing the add/commit/push
If the we manage to do the pull, than the push will go smoothly. In this case the
procedure stops here!

So, if the pull works without errors, we can do the add/commit/push, otherwise we need
to follow the next steps.

2) git stash save
Now our local changes, which creates the merging conflict, are saved somewhere

3) git pull
Now the pull should succeed, since we've stashed our local changes.

4) git stash pop

5) Manage manually the conflicts between our local changes that we have just "popped"

6) git add/commit/push (FINALLY!)

7) git stash clear
delete our local changes, we don't want them once we have pushed!


PS: I am not so sure that will work always, but for now I think that should be fine
